The user needs to login before he can use the application. For the moment it's enough to access:
http://localhost:8080/ControllerLayer/user/login.

After the user logged in he can access the following links:
-for transactions:
	http://localhost:8080/ControllerLayer/transaction/transferForm
	http://localhost:8080/ControllerLayer/transaction/dopositForm
	http://localhost:8080/ControllerLayer/transaction/withdrawalForm
-to see the details about an account:
	http://localhost:8080/ControllerLayer/account/accountForm
